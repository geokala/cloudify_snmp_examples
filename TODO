- Handle missing service, config files (with helpful error message)
- Confirm healthy configuration and rollback if not (keep copy of original during workflow, remove at end; can't use this for the uninstall because configuration may have been changed in the intervening time)
- Windows support, RHEL6 and RHEL7 support
- Support providing means to encrypt passwords (public key?) 
- Figure out (and fix) why any errors running commands give "Task failed 'cloudify_agent_snmp.tasks.add_cloudify_agent_to_snmpd' -> __init__() takes exactly 3 arguments (2 given) [retry 22/60]"
